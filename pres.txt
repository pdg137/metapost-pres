Meta-functional-programming with MetaPost / Metafont
====================================================

History
 - Metafont developed by Donald Knuth for TeX
 - Released (in a state similar to what it is now) in 1984
 - TrueType vs. MetaFont - quadratic vs. cubic splines
 - MetaPost - derived from Metafont
 - Asymptote - new software, missing the feature I want to talk about
   today.

Drawing with programs
 - Specify key points parametrically
 - Use vector math: z1 = (x1, y1)
 - Tools like fill, pens, splines, etc. to make it look nice

The cool functional thing about it
----------------------------------

You don't get to redefine variables with =

a = 1;
a = a+1;  % ERROR
a := a+1; % OK

In fact, = is for equations, not assignment:

% These are all equivalent:
a = 1;
1 = a;
a-1 = 0;

It can solve any linear equations:

Limitations
-----------

Nonlinear equations
But - can solve explicitly for some things like intersections.
